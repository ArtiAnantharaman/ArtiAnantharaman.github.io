title: 'Planning for a High-DOF Planar Arm'
---

In this programming assignment, I implemented four different sampling-based planners for a 5-DoF planar arm to move from its start joint angles to the goal joint angles. 

The four algorithms are:
1. Rapidly-exploring Random Tree(RRT)
2. RRT-Connect
3. RRT*
4. Probabilistic Roadmap(PRM)

I then compared the average planning times, average number of vertices generated, and the average path qualities of these planners.
